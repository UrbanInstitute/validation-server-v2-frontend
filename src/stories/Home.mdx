# Introduction to Storybook

Storybook is an open-source tool for developing UI components in isolation.
It's particularly valuable for building and documenting component libraries.
In this guide, we'll cover the basics of Storybook and how to use it effectively for the Urban Institute Validation Server Frontend component library.

## What is Storybook?

Storybook is a development environment for UI components, where you can:

- Develop and test components in isolation.
- Document and showcase your components.
- Collaborate with your team on UI components.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

Before you can start using Storybook, you need to install it. If you haven't already, you can install Storybook by installing the packages for this repo:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Running

To run storybook, run the `storybook` script:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This will start up a development server that will allow you to interact with the components and to preview them as you modify and or add new ones.

### 3. Developing

Storybook uses the components that the application uses.
It runs separately from the application, so you do not need to worry about the application logic while modifying the components.
This allows you to create and edit the components in ways that allows them to be re-usable.

Each component in this repository is located under `src/components/`.
Every component has it's own directory that allows for sub-components to be located alongside the primarily-used component.
For example, it does not make sense for every component in a stepper to be located separately, so the individual stepper components are located under `src/components/Stepper`.

To view the components, Storybook uses `story` files.
These files are located under `src/stories` and are named like `[component].stories.ts`.
Storybook will recognize the `stories` and use those files in the Storybook application.
